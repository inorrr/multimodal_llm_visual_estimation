This is the complete repository for the project **Improving Multi-modal Language Model on Object Counting with Self-Generated Side Information**.

## Instruction
Human performance: run `human_evaluation_gui.py` and start counting. 
1. Result will be saved to `FSC147_384_V2/selected_300_image_annotation.csv`, last column "human".
2. Seeing "No more images to label." means that we have finished all 300 images!!
